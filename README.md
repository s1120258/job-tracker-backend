## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Job Application Tracking  
- Create, update, and manage job applications with status fields, notes, and manually entered job descriptions.

### 📄 Resume Upload & AI Feedback  
- Upload a single resume (PDF/DOCX), extract its content automatically, and receive actionable improvement suggestions from an LLM.

### 🤖 Resume-to-Job Matching  
- Leverage vector embeddings (OpenAI or sentence-transformers with pgvector) to compare resumes with job descriptions and score compatibility.

### 📊 Analytics-Ready API  
- Built-in backend analytics endpoints to support dashboards — includes application status breakdowns, match score summaries, and trend analysis.

### 🔐 Secure Authentication  
- JWT-based user authentication system secures all protected API routes.

### ⚙️ Modular & Configurable  
- Environment-driven configuration using Pydantic, with easy customization for different environments.

### 🧪 Developer-First Workflow  
- Docker Compose for environment setup, unit and integration tests via `pytest`, code formatting with `black`, and CI/CD powered by GitHub Actions.
